    <p class="text-capitalize"> Of course I had to sit down to watch the 2021 action crime comedy titled "Red Notice" given the three leading performers that starred in this movie. Had I heard about the movie prior to finding it on Netflix? Nope. But then again, I don't really bother keeping up with trailers and forthcoming releases.

      Writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber definitely managed to put together a very entertaining and wholesome storyline and plot for "Red Notice". And it was a story that contains a good amount of action, comedy, thrills and plot twists. So yeah, I was certainly entertained from the very beginning and up to the end. And I must also admit that some of the plot twists were rather enjoyable and some that I hadn't foreseen coming.
      
      Needless to say that with a cast that includes Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson, then of course you are in for a stellar time with great performances. And the three lead performers definitely delivered. It should be noted that the performance from Chris Diamantopoulos and Daniel Bernhardt were also good, just wish that the latter had a bigger part to play in the movie.
      
      "Red Notice" takes you all across the world in a wonderful heist adventure with interesting characters, fast paced action, good comedy and also good dialogue. And the fact that the movie was very dynamic in its cinematography definitely helped to sell the movie.
      
      You should certainly sit down to watch "Red Notice" if you get the chance.
      
      My rating of "Red Notice" lands on a very well-deserved eight out of ten stars.
